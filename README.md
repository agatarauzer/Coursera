5. #### Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System

   Conducted by Duke University /  Level: intermediate / 5 hours


   Course was focused on building a recommendation system, using given input files on users ratings and movie titles. 
   It covers following steps:
   - Read in and parse data into lists and maps.
   - Calculate average ratings.
   - Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings.
   - Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
   - Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
